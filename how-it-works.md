Here are some examples of where Pathagar has been deployed. Here's where you can
see Pathagar in action.


## Offline

Pathagar works without an Internet connection.


## ODPS feeds

The [Open Publication Distribution System (ODPS)](http://opds-spec.org/specs/)
allows different publication sources to publish a catalog, allowing a client to
pull publications from any ODPS compatible source. This means that a client can
browse catalogs from multiple Pathagar instances and download publications from
any one of them.


## Rich documentation

Here you can learn more about how to install and deploy Pathagar yourself.
